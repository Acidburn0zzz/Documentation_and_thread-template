# **This is the official thread template for AospExtended.**

_*Maintainers are asked to follow the guidlines in the template. *Always take at least two reserved posts! *Be respectful to users. *If any fuss is created report us first. *Post Screenshots only in screenshots section *Create a XDA Dev Project and then post.*_

_*Now we have a download website, where Official Builds are posted. So if you are an official maintainer then create a pull request for it. Sumbit your Name, XDA Thread Link, XDA Profile Link, Device Name and Android Filehost Folder Link. The repo for official devices is present on our github. So please refer to it. And Sumbit it ASAP.*_

_*Our OTA app has a feature to give device specific changelogs! You can go here [Device specific changelogs](https://github.com/AospExtended-Devices/Changelogs) and create a new .md file with the codename of your device, devicecodename.md and write your changelogs in markdown format and do a Pull request.*
